[EPITECH] my_hunter

*Asteroid game*

## WHAT IS IT ?

my_hunter is the first game I ever made, using the CSFML library !
In this project, I was asked to make a small video game based on the rules of Duck Hunt.
I took a few liberty to make something I'm proud of üëç

## HOW TO RUN
Clone the repository, and then run the ```./my_hunter``` binary at the root of the repo.
If you can't find it, run ```make re``` at the root of the repo.

## HOW TO PLAY

Each time you click on the screen, you will shoot a bullet.

On the menu screen:
Shoot a bullet on *START* to start the game.
Shoot a bullet on *INFOS* to display more infos about the game, in the terminal.
Shoot a bullet on *QUIT* if you hate my game.

Once the game has started:
Enemies will start spawning, shoot them up !
Be careful, each time you miss an enemy, a new one will spawn.
Your score is displayed as the title of the window.
If you press the esc key on your keyboard, it will pause the game.
If the window lose focus, it will pause the game.

You can change the difficulty !
If you are on the menu or pause screen, and shoot a bullet outside the window, it will spawn an additionnal enemy.

THANK YOU FOR PLAYING !!
